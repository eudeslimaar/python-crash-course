# Python Crash Course

This repository contains my records and solutions to the challenges presented in the book "[Python Crash course](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=python+crash+course&crid=2WMM118UE8QR0&sprefix=python%2Caps%2C228&ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_3_6)". I'm actively exploring and practicing the concepts outlined in the book, covering everything from basic exercises to more complex projects. Through this space, I aim to document my learning journey in Python, experimenting with various approaches, and refining my programming skills.
